 Graph Reprensentation Learning
 
 Metric Learning
 
 Learning to Rank
 
 RNN for ND problem for dynamic system. What's wrong with Auto-regression models?
 
 Apply Word2Vec on neighborhood-graph to form dimension reduction. Then a PCA-like ND model got.
 
 S2SVDD with geodesic distance to form w_{ij}
 
 GAN/Adversarial Metric Learning. Minimax problem. Min Intro-class distance. Max inter-class distance.
 
 SVDD with Metric Learning MMC [Xing et al., 2002]https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2164-distance-metric-learning-with-application-to-clustering-with-side-information.pdf. "dissimilar" and "outter hypersphere". Notice: Paper is different from http://researchers.lille.inria.fr/abellet/talks/metric_learning_tutorial_CIL.pdf Page. 30.
 
 Active Learning and Semi-Supervised Learning w.r.t Metric Learning. "littel side information" and "much side information" ?
