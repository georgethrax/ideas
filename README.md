  ## Graph Reprensentation Learning
  ## Metric Learning
  ## Learning to Rank
  ## RNN for ND problem for dynamic system. What's wrong with Auto-regression models?
  ## Apply Word2Vec on neighborhood-graph to form dimension reduction. Then a PCA-like ND model got.
  ## S2SVDD with geodesic distance to form w_{ij}
  ## GAN/Adversarial Metric Learning. Minimax problem. Min Intro-class distance. Max inter-class distance.
